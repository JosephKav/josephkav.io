      Setting up the business’ software using AWS services. They are a new company, aiming to provide sensors to companies along with a free app that anyone could download so that they can see whether a place that is subscribed to Flow is busy, in real time.

      I was involved in:
      * Setting up the database to store all of the data
      * Creating the backend API that the app talks to when it wants to retrieve data
      * Setting up authentication on this so that each user can only see and edit what they need to.

      The business is still very early in development, so there isn’t much publicly available about this company.
